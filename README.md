# Integrated Project Management System

## Overview

The Integrated Project Management System is a Spring Boot application designed to manage various aspects of project management. This includes tasks such as tracking project progress, managing resources, and facilitating communication among team members.

## Main Components

1. **Spring Boot Application**:
   - The main entry point of the application is the `IntegratedProjectManagementSystemApplication` class. This class contains the `main` method which uses `SpringApplication.run` to launch the application.

2. **Dependencies**:
   - The project relies on various Spring Boot starters and other dependencies defined in the `pom.xml` file. These dependencies provide functionalities such as web support, data access, security, etc.

3. **Configuration**:
   - Configuration files such as `application.properties` or `application.yml` are used to define application-specific settings, such as database connection details, server port, etc.

4. **Controllers**:
   - Controllers handle HTTP requests and map them to appropriate service methods. They are typically annotated with `@RestController` or `@Controller`.

5. **Services**:
   - Service classes contain the business logic of the application. They are annotated with `@Service`.

6. **Repositories**:
   - Repository interfaces handle data access and are typically annotated with `@Repository`. They extend Spring Data JPA repositories to provide CRUD operations.

## How to Run

1. **Ensure you have Java and Maven installed**:
   - Check Java installation:
     ```sh
     java -version
     ```
   - Check Maven installation:
     ```sh
     mvn -version
     ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```sh
   cd /home/ashishk/Desktop/Ashish/spring\ boot/Integrated-Project-Management-System
   ```

3. **Build the project**:
   ```sh
   mvn clean install
   ```

4. **Run the Spring Boot application**:
   ```sh
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

   Alternatively, you can run the generated JAR file directly:
   ```sh
   java -jar target/Integrated-Project-Management-System-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
   ```

## Conclusion

This project serves as a comprehensive solution for managing projects efficiently. By leveraging Spring Boot, it ensures scalability, maintainability, and ease of development.
